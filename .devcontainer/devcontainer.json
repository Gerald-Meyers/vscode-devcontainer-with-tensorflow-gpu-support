  // Details: This name appears in the VS Code UI when selecting or managing the container (e.g., in the Remote Explorer).
  "name" : "Tensorflow Devcontainer",
  
  // dockerComposeFile: Specifies the Docker Compose file(s) used to define the dev container environment.
  // Details: An array of paths (relative to devcontainer.json) to one or more docker-compose.yml files. VS Code will use 
  //    Docker Compose to build and run the services defined within these files instead of using the 'build' or 'image' properties. 
  //    Requires the 'service' property to also be defined.
  // Use Case: Define multi-container development environments (e.g., application + database + cache) or manage complex 
  //    single-service configurations using Docker Compose.
  "dockerComposeFile" : [
    "../.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml"
  ],

  // service: Specifies the target service within the Docker Compose setup for VS Code to attach to.
  // Details: This value MUST match the name of a service defined in the docker-compose.yml file(s) listed in 'dockerComposeFile'. 
  //    VS Code will connect its UI and terminal to this specific container.
  // Use Case: Required when using 'dockerComposeFile' to identify the primary development container among potentially multiple 
  //    services (like app, database, etc.).
  "service": "app",
  
  // workspaceFolder: Specifies the default directory to open inside the container.
  // Details: This path inside the container tells VS Code where your project files are located after attaching. 
  //    It should match the 'target' path of your primary code mount (defined either in 'workspaceMount' or in the Docker Compose file's 'volumes').
  // Use Case: Ensures VS Code opens the correct folder containing your project code within the container environment.
  "workspaceFolder" : "/workspace",

  // forwardPorts: Forwards ports from the container to the host machine.
  // Details: An array of port numbers (e.g., [8000, 5432]) or ranges ("8000-8010"). Ports listed here become accessible via 
  //    localhost:<port> on your local machine.
  // Use Case: Access web applications, databases, TensorBoard, Jupyter, or other services running inside the container from your host's browser or tools.
  "forwardPorts" : [],

  // features: Configures "Features" (pre-packaged installation scripts) to inject additional tools.
  // Details: An object mapping Feature IDs to configuration options. Features allow you to quickly install 
  //    common tools (like Git, Docker CLI, AWS CLI) without writing custom Dockerfile commands.
  // Use Case: Essential for adding tools that are missing from the base image, such as ensuring 'git' is available.
  "features": {

  },
  
  // portsAttributes: Provides additional configuration for forwarded ports.
  // Details: An object mapping port numbers (as strings) to settings like 'label', 'onAutoForward', 'protocol'. 
  //    This is an optional, and may subset the ports listed in "forwardPorts".
  // Use Case: Give descriptive names to forwarded ports in the UI, control auto-forwarding behavior.
  "portsAttributes" : {

    // "8000": {

    //   "protocol": "http"          // Options: http, https; defaults to http
 
    // onAutoForward: Controls VS Code's action when a forwarded port becomes active.
    // Details: Specifies the behavior when the Dev Containers extension detects activity on a port listed in 'forwardPorts'.
    // Options:
    //   "notify"      - (Default) Show a notification asking if you want to open the port in a browser.
    //   "openBrowser" - Automatically open the host's default web browser to the forwarded port (using http/https protocol if specified).
    //   "openPreview" - Attempt to open the forwarded port in VS Code's embedded Simple Browser.
    //   "silent"      - Forward the port without showing any notification or taking any action.

    // protocol: Specifies the network protocol (http or https) used by the service on a forwarded port.
    // Details: A string value, either "http" or "https". Defaults to "http" if omitted.
    // Use Case: Helps VS Code construct the correct URL (e.g., http://localhost:<port> vs https://localhost:<port>) when using actions like "openBrowser" in 'onAutoForward'.
  },

  // remoteEnv: Sets environment variables specifically for VS Code Server and its processes (terminal, debugger).
  // Details: An object mapping environment variable names to string values. These are applied after connecting.
  // Use Case: Configure environment variables needed only by VS Code tools or override container-wide settings for the VS Code session.
  "remoteEnv": {},

  // overrideCommand: Determines whether the container's default command (ENTRYPOINT/CMD) should be overridden.
  // Details: A boolean value (true or false). Defaults to true. When true, VS Code ignores the image's default command and runs a 
  //    command like 'sleep infinity' to keep the container running idly. When false, the container runs its original ENTRYPOINT/CMD as defined in the Dockerfile.
  // Use Case: Set to true (default) for typical development workflows where you want the container to stay alive for VS Code to connect. 
  //    Set to false only if you specifically need the container's original ENTRYPOINT to run instead (uncommon for dev containers, as the container might exit).
  "overrideCommand": true,

  // updateContentCommand: Executes a command/script ONCE.
  // Timing: Runs after the container is created and your project files are available inside, but before postCreateCommand.
  // Use Case: For setup needing the source code, like installing requirements from a cloned file or updating Git submodules.
  // EXAMPLE - "install dev tools" : "bash .devcontainer/install-dev-tools.sh"
  "updateContentCommand" : {},

  // postCreateCommand: Executes a command/script ONCE.
  // Timing: Runs after the container is created (and after updateContentCommand if present), but before VS Code connects.
  // Use Case: Ideal for general one-time setup tasks like installing global tools, initializing databases, or cloning dependent repositories.
  "postCreateCommand" : {},

  // postStartCommand: Executes a command/script EVERY time the container starts.
  // Timing: Runs after the container boots up (and after postCreateCommand on first start), but before VS Code connects.
  // Use Case: Ideal for starting background services or running tasks needed at the beginning of each session.
  "postStartCommand" : {},

  // postAttachCommand: Executes a command/script EVERY time VS Code attaches to the container.
  // Timing: Runs after VS Code connects to the already running container (including on window reloads).
  // Use Case: Ideal for commands related to the active VS Code session, like starting a development server in the integrated terminal.
