    # Mount your project code into the container
    volumes:
      # Volume mount options control consistency between host and container (Docker Desktop only):
      # :cached      - Optimizes for container write speed; host view may have a slight delay. Good for general development.
      # :delegated   - Maximizes container performance; host view may have longer delays. Good for container-heavy I/O.
      # :consistent  - (Or omitting the option) Ensures perfect sync; potentially slower. Use if host needs instant updates from container.
      - ..:/workspace:cached
      # Add other mounts here if needed, corresponding to devcontainer.json -> mounts
      # Example: Mount gcloud config (adjust source path if needed)
      # - ${APPDATA}/gcloud:/root/.config/gcloud:cached 
      # Example: Mount the host's S: drive to /mnt/storage inside this container
      # - /s/:/mnt/storage:cached
      # Or potentially: 
      # - //s/:/mnt/s_drive:cached
      # Windows host path needs escaping or different env var handling
      # --- Portable Mount Examples ---
      # Example: Mount a sub-directory for configs
      # - ./config:/app/config:ro # Mounts './config' read-only
      # Example: Use a named volume (defined below) for persistent data
      # - app_data:/app/data
    
    # Keeps the container running for VS Code to attach
    command: sleep infinity
    
    # --- GPU Configuration ---
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: all # Or specify specific GPU IDs
              capabilities: [gpu]
    
    # Equivalent of remoteEnv
    # environment:
    #   EXAMPLE_ENV_VAR: value

    # Equivalent of runArgs port mapping (-p)
    # ports:
    #   - "8080:8080"

  # --- Example: PostgreSQL Service with Portable Data Volume ---
  # db:
  #   image: postgres:15
  #   restart: always
  #   environment:
  #     POSTGRES_DB: mydatabase
  #     POSTGRES_USER: myuser
  #     POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mysecretpassword # Use secrets in production!
  #   volumes:
  #     # Mount the Docker-managed named volume 'postgres_data'
  #     - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  #   # ports:
  #   #   - "5432:5432"

# --- Top-Level Volume Declarations ---
# Define Docker-managed named volumes here for persistent data.
# Docker handles where these are stored on the host, making it portable.
# volumes:
#   postgres_data:
#     # driver: local # Default driver
